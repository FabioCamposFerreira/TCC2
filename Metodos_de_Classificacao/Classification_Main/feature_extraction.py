# Contains modules for extracting features from the images processed by the **image_processing.py** modules
# In general, the modules receive the images processed by the **feature_extraction.py** modules, extracted and treated features with their identification labels, are the input to the **training.py** modules
# When run as **main**, graphics and tables are generated to compare the features
